Ninchat is a cloud based communication service for businesses. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE PLATFORM
Offer help to your customers when and where they need it! Embed the customer care chat to your website, mobile site, applications and Facebook page.
Ninchat provides easy-to-use statistics per agent and chat topic, including: service level, chat lengths, customer satisfactions, response times, chat lengths, exit-tolerance, chat transcripts. Statistics can also be exported.
You can easily integrate Ninchat to your existing CRM/ERP systems, like SAP BCM 7.0.
Ninchat uses the strongest available encryption options for securing communications and stored data. 

TEAM COMMUNICATION
Create group chats for teams and topics, and chat privately one on one. Team chat with keyword alerts makes agent reaction time faster, transfers silent knowledge and increases team efficiency

LIVE GROUP DISCUSSIONS
Embed Ninchat as a group discussion channel, shoutbox or customer wall on your site.
Ninchat can be embedded anywhere the end users are - e.g. on a website, mobile site, application or a social media site. 

Ninchat focuses on secure communications, high compatibility, customizability, and cross device use.
